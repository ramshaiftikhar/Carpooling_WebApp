# Carpooling-Web-Application

# Steps to execute the project

1. Open MAMP,go to PHP Myadmin, create a database with the name Carpool1
2. Copy the code in the Carpool1.sql file, and use it to import the database for the project
3. Open index.php and from there you can navigate to whichever page you like 
4. The current sql file also contains some sample records, so you can use those or create your own to check functionality

# Software Dependencies

1. You would need a cloudinary account to store the profile pictures of the users online. The current one is already linked with my account. You can change that if you wish.
2. You would need an account on sendgrid.com which is used in the project to send emails from a remote server. In the current config, I have added my own account there. You would also need to download and install PHPMailer using COMPOSER to get this functionality running.
